This is basically a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete ) application, and also I have used the session variable for maintaining sessions. I have used PHP and MySQL databases for the backend and for the frontend I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. New users have to register on the site and existing users can log in to the site with proper credentials. There is only one login interface provided for the normal user and as well for admin. It will automatically recognize the type of logged-in user. If the logged-in user is the admin then it will provide an admin home page otherwise for the normal user it will provide the normal user home page. Admin users can view all the normal users and delete them when needed. Normal users can view, update their details on the site.
